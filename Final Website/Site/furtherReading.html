			<h2> Validation Services </h2>
			<p> HTML and CSS both have various standardisation to them. Depending on which type you are using, you will need to ensure that the code which you write is valid within the standard that you are writing to.
			As different standardisations have some attributes which are available to them, but which are not to others. To ensure that your code is valid for that type, you can use w3schools' online validators.
			Submit your code to them and validate them to the required standard. You can find the <a href = "https://validator.w3.org/">HTML validator here</a> and the <a href = "https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">
			CSS validator here.</a> </p>
