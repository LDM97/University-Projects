			<h2> How the Internet Works </h2>
			<div class = "pagePictures"> <a href = "HistoryPage.html"> <img src = "Images/historypicture.jpg" width = "200" height = "100" alt = "History" /> </a> </div>
			<p> The internet is a fascinating structure of digital communication. Understanding how this structure works and the protocols that are used is invaluable background knowledge to any
				website developer. While it may not directly relate to making basic websites that you will start with, it will give you a deeper understanding of the subject. Click the picture
				to read up on how the internet works. </p>

			<h2> HTML </h2>
			<div class = "pagePictures"> <a href = "HTMLPage.html" > <img src = "Images/HTMLPicture.jpg" width = "200" height = "100" alt = "HTML" /> </a> </div>
			<p> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) makes up the basic frame of web pages. A basic web page can be made solely with html, but it is typically accompanied by CSS and JavaScript to make the site more visually appealing.
				As a result, HTML is often used as the main framework for a site's layout and main features, which are then formatted and enhanced by CSS and JavaScript. Click the image to learn the basics
				of how to use HTML. </p>

			<h2> CSS </h2>
			<div class = "pagePictures"> <a href = "CSSPage.html" > <img src = "Images/CSSPicture.jpg" width = "200" height = "100" alt = "CSS" /> </a> </div>
			<p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to format an existing HTML document. They work by selecting a specific tag in the HTML document and then apply formatting to the elements within that tag.
				CSS offers more complex formatting than HTML's basic formatting capabilities, meaning that, in good hands, CSS can be used to make a visually appealing website. Click the image to learn the basics
				of CSS.</p>
